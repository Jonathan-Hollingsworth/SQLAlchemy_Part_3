# SQLAlchemy_Part_3

This is the third and final part of a multi-part assessment for creating a blogging app.  
This part adds a way to add, edit, and delete tags for your posts.  
> There are no new tests that were made  
> Use `CTRL + LeftClick` to select multiple tags (Or any other multi-select your OS might have)
